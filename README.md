# To Do List

## Totally
*Test project for showing the grade of codes*
*This is to do list with tasks, statistics and profile data (now realized only tasks)*
*The package ***[json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)*** used instead of back-end*

### Totally functional
 - :white_check_mark Test
    - creating columns and tasks;
    - changing data of tasks and columns;
    - dropping tasks and columns;
    - filtering by tags of tasks (highlighting the current tasks);
    - other stuff (e.g. rename column, sorting, ...);
- Profile;
- Statistics;

### Start the app
 - rename the file ***initial-db.json*** -> ***db.json***
 - `npm run start` -- start the app in a develope mode;
 - `json-server --watch db.json` -- start the base data for this app;
