# To Do List

## Totally
*Test project for showing the grade of codes*
*This is to do list with tasks, statistics and profile data (now realized only tasks)*
*The package ***[json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)*** used instead of back-end*

### Start the app
 - rename the file ***db.dist.json*** -> ***db.json***
 - rename the file ***.env.dist*** -> ***.env***
 - `npm run start` -- start the app in a develope mode;
 - `json-server --watch db.json` -- start the base data for this app;
